# Excavator Operator Performance - Discrete Event Simulation 

This repository contains the model developed for the paper 'Utilizing Digital Twins to Model and Optimize Shovel Operator Performance Through Arena Simulation.'

## Project Description
This project examines how operators control hydraulic shovels, focusing on swing motion and bucket rotation. The goal is to understand operator behavior and its impact on efficiency.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repository.
3. Ensure that MATLAB and Arena are installed on your system.
4. Place the desired XLSX data file in an accessible location on your computer.

## Features
- Select an Excel file containing data.
- Automatically processes the data and creates separate variables for each operator.
- Provides detailed instructions on fitting the data using MATLAB's Distribution Fitter.

## Usage

### 1. Finding the Best Fit Distribution
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Run the script by entering the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:
    ```matlab
    DataProcessingTool
    ```
3. Select the XLSX file (e.g., `Data_Rate.xlsx`) that contains the table template. **Note**: It is not necessary to strictly follow the template, but using it can help maintain consistency.
4. Run the MATLAB script (`OperatorDataProcessing.m`) and select the appropriate data folder.
5. Use the **Distribution Fitter App** in MATLAB to identify the best-fit distribution for the data.

### 2. Running the Arena Model
1. Open the Arena model file (`operatorPerformance_Arena.doe`).
2. Modify the input variables as required. (You can locate the exact variable inputs within the Arena model.)
3. Run the simulation and generate the report, or navigate to the modelâ€™s folder and open the `.OUT` file to view the output results.
