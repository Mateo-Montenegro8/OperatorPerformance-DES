# Excavator Operator Performance - Discrete Event Simulation 

This repository contains the model developed for the paper 'Utilizing Digital Twins to Model and Optimize Shovel Operator Performance Through Arena Simulation.'

## Project Description
This project examines how operators control hydraulic shovels, focusing on swing motion and bucket rotation. The goal is to understand operator behavior and its impact on efficiency.

## Features
- Select an Excel file containing data.
- Automatically processes the data and creates separate variables for each operator.
- Provides detailed instructions on fitting the data using MATLAB's Distribution Fitter.

## Installation

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**  
   - Click on the green **Code** button and select **Download ZIP**, or use:  
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
     ```
   
2. **Install Required Software**  
   - Ensure that **MATLAB R2024a** (or later) and **Arena v16.1** are installed on your system.  

3. **Prepare Your Data**  
   - Place the required **XLSX** data file in an easily accessible location on your computer.  

4. **Run the Project**  
   - Open MATLAB, navigate to the project folder, and execute the script to process the data.
