# Excavator Operator Performance - Discrete Event Simulation 

This repository contains the model developed for the paper 'Utilizing Digital Twins to Model and Optimize Shovel Operator Performance Through Arena Simulation.'

## Project Description
This project examines how operators control hydraulic shovels, focusing on swing motion and bucket rotation. The goal is to understand operator behavior and its impact on efficiency.

## Features
- Select an Excel file containing data.
- Automatically processes the data and creates separate variables for each operator.
- Provides detailed instructions on fitting the data using MATLAB's Distribution Fitter.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (with the "Distribution Fitter" App)
- Excel file containing operator data with the first column representing operator numbers and subsequent columns for data.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repository.
3. Ensure that MATLAB and Arena are installed on your system.
4. Place the desired Excel file in an accessible location on your computer.

## Usage

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Run the script by typing the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:

   ```matlab
   DataProcessingTool
